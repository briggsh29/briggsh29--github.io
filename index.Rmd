## Welcome to my Website 

I am a 2nd year graduate student and MPH Candidate at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health.

You can find information on my professional and academic experiences under the "Resume" tab or via the link below:

I have also put together a dashboard on a sample dataset and visualizations under the "Sample Data" tab. The dataset in this example is from NYC Restaurant Inspection Results.
